# Digit Project Overview

## Project Description

This is a summary of the files and components included in the Digit application. The application was generated using the AppWizard for Visual C++ projects.

## Project Files

### `digit.vcxproj`

- **Description**: This is the main project file for VC++ projects created using the Application Wizard.
- **Contents**: Contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, as well as details about platforms, configurations, and project features selected during project setup.

### `digit.vcxproj.filters`

- **Description**: This file manages the association between the files in the project and the filters in the IDE.
- **Purpose**: Helps in grouping files with similar extensions (e.g., `.cpp` files are grouped under the "Source Files" filter) for better organization within the IDE.

### `digit.cpp`

- **Description**: This is the main source file for the Digit application.
- **Purpose**: Contains the primary code for the applicationâ€™s functionality.
